=======================

Scripts to aid in the hosting of Minecraft servers on a Linux enviornment

Most of the scripts in this repo require Minecraft to run inside a GNU screen. This can be done as follows:

    screen -dmS minecraft java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui

More documentation is on its way.
